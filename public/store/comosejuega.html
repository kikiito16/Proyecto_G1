        <h1>Player Mechanics & the Game.</h1>

        <p>Tired of been brutally beaten by the college life? Well, this is not gonna change, but at least you can take all this
        tense and self-hating for sleep 3 hours/day and play our game.</p>

        <p>The mechanics of the game are simple, with your finger you can make the player moved on through each week. </p>
        <p>The objective gain the money to compensate all the second enrollments that you have did on all this years, and
            go the exit to the next Week.</p>

        <p>But be careful, you will have to fight and defend from a lot of enemies, that in a first touch you can think that
        they aren't what they seem to be.</p>



        <p>The enemies will be based on the <strong>college friends</strong>:</p>
        <p>Who doesn't has been on these days of the semester where you have to study and always there is the same guy that tells you to go out</p>
        <p>Then you finish the first beer and the posterior moment is you getting up at 4 pm with a blackout and with a pile of exercises to study.</p>


        <p>Then we will have <strong>our beloved professors</strong> always implicated on our learningship but then be like: "oh a 4.85 it's not a 5 men, sorry".</p>

        <p>Then we put available some objects that will help you to reach your goal: <strong>THE GRADE TITLE</strong></p>
